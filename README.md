# SpartanClash
  Passion project still in development.  SpartanClash combines match data from the Halo 5 API and user information scraped from Halowaypoint.com to create a leaderboard experience for avid fans.  
  
I've migrated this project over to .NET Core as of September 2017, so please check out that [repository](https://github.com/C-Kennelly/SpartanClashCore/tree/master) for new developments.  The migration to .NET Core is great because it lets a few Mac-using friends of mine contribute without the use of VM's, as well as allows me to get out of the Windows Server Administration business.  I'll be leaving this respository up for posterity.
