<div class="question">
    <h3><b>What does Spartan Clash do?</b></h3>
    <p>
        Spartan Clash hosts leaderboards that show which Spartan Companies are "the best."  Right now, we only show Warzone wins, but we expect the site to evolve over the next few months.
        Ultimately, we want you to be able to track your progress and find rivals Companies to challenge.
    </p>

<div class="question">
    <h3><b>How do you track matches?</b></h3>
    <p>
        We use the Spartan Company lists published on Waypoint and the Halo 5 API to generate a list of possible matches.  Then we sift through those matches to find "battles," and publish the results here.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="question">
    <h3><b>Which matches do you track? </b></h3>
    <p>
        We count any match that has a full fireteam, so 6 members from your Spartan Company must finish the match on the same team. We refresh the Company rosters every two weeks.
    </p>

<div class="question">
    <h3><b>Will you track my Spartan Company? </b></h3>
    <p>
        If you want Clash to track your Spartan Company in 2017 or have feedback for the full release, email SpartanClashPilot@gmail.com with your Company name and what kind of info you're interested in seeing.
        There are over 40,000 Spartan companies, so knowing which ones to track first is really helpful.
